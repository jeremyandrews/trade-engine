## ask price
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask_price
 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/ask.asp
```
Ask price, also called offer price, offer, asking price, or simply ask, is the price a seller states
they will accept.

The seller may qualify the stated asking price as firm or negotiable. Firm means the seller is
implying that the price is fixed and will not change.

In bid and ask, the term ask price is used in contrast to the term bid price. The difference between
the bid price and the ask price is called the spread. 
```

```
In the context of stock trading on a stock exchange, the ask price is the lowest price a seller of a
stock is willing to accept for a share of that given stock. For over-the-counter stocks, the asking
price is the best quoted price at which a market maker is willing to sell a stock.
```

## strike price
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_price
 
_options_

```
In finance, the strike price (or exercise price) of an option is the fixed price at which the owner
of the option can buy (in the case of a call), or sell (in the case of a put), the underlying
security or commodity. The strike price may be set by reference to the spot price (market price) of
the underlying security or commodity on the day an option is taken out, or it may be fixed at a
discount or at a premium.

The strike price is a key variable in a derivatives contract between two parties. Where the contract
requires delivery of the underlying instrument, the trade will be at the strike price, regardless of
the market price of the underlying instrument at that time. 
```

## bid price
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid_price
 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid.asp
 
```
A bid price is the highest price that a buyer (i.e., bidder) is willing to pay for a good. It is
usually referred to simply as the "bid".

In bid and ask, the bid price stands in contrast to the ask price or "offer", and the difference
between the two is called the bid–ask spread.

An unsolicited bid or purchase offer is when a person or company receives a bid even though they are
not looking to sell. 
```

```
In the context of stock trading on a stock exchange, the bid price is the highest price a buyer of a
stock is willing to pay for a share of that given stock. The bid price displayed in most quote
services is the highest bid price in the market. The ask or offer price on the other hand is the
lowest price a seller of a particular stock is willing to sell a share of that given stock. The ask
or offer price displayed is the lowest ask/offer price in the market (Stock market). 
```

## ask state
Does not appear to be a generic term. Could refer to firm versus negotiable as discussed in ask price.

## bid state

## spread
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bid%E2%80%93ask_spread
 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/spread.asp
 
```
The bid–ask spread (also bid–offer or bid/ask and buy/sell in the case of a market maker), is the
difference between he prices quoted (either by a single market maker or in a limit order book) for
an immediate sale (offer) and an immediate purchase (bid) for stocks, futures contracts, options, or
currency pairs. The size of the bid-offer spread in a security is one measure of the liquidity of the
market and of the size of the transaction cost. If the spread is 0 then it is a frictionless asset.

## volume
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volume_%28finance%29
 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/volume.asp
 
```
In capital markets, volume, or trading volume, is the amount (total number) of a security (or a given
set of securities, or an entire market) that was traded during a given period of time. In the context
of a single stock trading on a stock exchange, the volume is commonly reported as the number of
shares that changed hands during a given day. The transactions are measured on stocks, bonds, options
contracts, futures contracts and commodities.

The average volume of a security over a longer period of time is the total amount traded in that
period, divided by the length of the period. Therefore, the unit of measurement for average volume
is shares per unit of time, typically per trading day. 
```

## order
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(exchange)
```
An order is an instruction to buy or sell on a trading venue such as a stock market, bond market,
commodity market, financial derivative market or cryptocurrency exchange. These instructions can be
simple or complicated, and can be sent to either a broker or directly to a trading venue via direct
market access. There are some standard instructions for such orders. 
```

## trade
 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade.asp
```
Trade is a basic economic concept involving the buying and selling of goods and services, with
compensation paid by a buyer to a seller, or the exchange of goods or services between parties. The
most common medium of exchange for these transactions is money, but trade may also be executed with
the exchange of goods or services between both parties, referred to as a barter, or payment with
virtual currency, the most popular of which is bitcoin. In financial markets, trading refers to the
buying and selling of securities, such as the purchase of stock on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE).
```

## market
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_(organized_market)
 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/market.asp
```
A market is a medium that allows buyers and sellers of a specific good or service to interact in
order to facilitate an exchange. This type of market may either be a physical marketplace where
people come together to exchange goods and services in person, as in a bazaar or shopping center, or
a virtual market wherein buyers and sellers do not interact, as in an online market. Market can also
refer to the general market where securities are traded. This form of the term may also refer to
specific securities markets and may take place in person or online. The term "market" can also refer
to people with the desire and ability to buy a specific product or service.
```

## orderbook
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book_(trading)
 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp
```
An order book is the list of orders (manual or electronic) that a trading venue (in particular stock
exchanges) uses to record the interest of buyers and sellers in a particular financial instrument. A
matching engine uses the book to determine which orders can be fulfilled i.e. what trades can be
made. 
```

## market order
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(exchange)#Market_order
 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketorder.asp
```
A market order is a buy or sell order to be executed immediately at the current market prices. As
long as there are willing sellers and buyers, market orders are filled. Market orders are used when
certainty of execution is a priority over the price of execution.

A market order is the simplest of the order types. This order type does not allow any control over
the price received. The order is filled at the best price available at the relevant time. In
fast-moving markets, the price paid or received may be quite different from the last price quoted
before the order was entered.

A market order may be split across multiple participants on the other side of the transaction,
resulting in different prices for some of the shares. It is the most basic of all orders and
therefore, they incur the lowest of commissions, from both online and traditional brokers.
```

## limit order
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(exchange)#Limit_order
 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/limitorder.asp
```
A limit order is an order to buy a security at no more than a specific price, or to sell a security
at no less than a specific price (called "or better" for either direction). This gives the trader
(customer) control over the price at which the trade is executed; however, the order may never be
executed ("filled"). Limit orders are used when the trader wishes to control price rather than
certainty of execution. 
```

## open order

## time in force
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(exchange)#Time_in_force

```
A day order or good for day order (GFD) (the most common) is a market or limit order that is in
force from the time the order is submitted to the end of the day's trading session. For stock
markets, the closing time is defined by the exchange. For the foreign exchange market, this is until
5 p.m. EST/EDT for all currencies except the New Zealand Dollar. 
```

### Good-til-cancelled (GTC)
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_%27til_cancelled
_time in force_
```
Good-til-cancelled (GTC) orders require a specific cancelling order, which can persist indefinitely
(although brokers may set some limits, for example, 90 days).
```

### Immediate or cancel (IOC)
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_or_cancel
_time in force_
```
Immediate or cancel (IOC) orders are immediately executed or cancelled by the exchange. Unlike FOK
orders, IOC orders allow for partial fills.
```

```
An immediate or cancel (IOC) order, also known as an "accept order", is a finance term used in
investment banking or securities transactions that refers "an order to buy or sell a stock that
must be executed immediately". In case the entire order is not available at that moment for
purchase a partial fulfillment is possible, but any portion of an IOC order that cannot be filled
immediately is cancelled, eliminating the need for manual cancellation. This "partial fulfillment"
aspect is what differentiates IOC orders from all or none (AON) and fill or kill (FOK) orders.
```

### Fill or kill (FOK)
 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fill_or_kill
_time in force_
```
Fill or kill (FOK) orders are usually limit orders that must be executed or cancelled immediately.
Unlike IOC orders, FOK orders require the full quantity to be executed. 
```

## fill
 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fill.asp
```
A fill is the action of completing or satisfying an order for a security or commodity. It is the
basic act in transacting stocks, bonds or any other type of security.
```

 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fill

In finance, a fill is the fulfillment of a part or whole of an order at a given price by a broker
or counterparty
```

```

## bottom
 - https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bottom.asp

Often, a specific time span is used to determine a bottom, and that timeframe can be a year, month
or even intraday.
